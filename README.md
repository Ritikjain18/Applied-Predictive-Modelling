# Applied-Predictive-Modelling
The process of developing a mathematical tool or model that generates an accurate prediction.
There are a number of common reasons why predictive models fails, and we address each of these in subsequent topics.
The common culprits include-
1. inadequate processing of data
2. inadequate model validation
3. unjustified extrapolation(e.g. application of the model to data that reside in a space which the model has never seen)
4. over-fitting the model to the existing data.

We are primarly interested in accurately projecting the chances that something will(or will not) happen.For example, we don’t really care why an e-mail filter thinks a message is spam. Rather, we only care that the filter accurately trashes spam and allows messages we care about to pass
through to our mailbox.
To summarize, the foundation of an effective predictive model is laid with
intuition and deep knowledge of the problem context, which are entirely vital for
driving decisions about model development.

# Terminology

To summarize, the foundation of an effective predictive model is laid with
intuition and deep knowledge of the problem context, which are entirely vital for
driving decisions about model development.

* The terms sample, data point, observation, or instance refer to a single,
independent unit of data, such as a customer, patient, or compound.
The term sample can also refer to a subset of data points, such as the
training set sample. The text will clarify the appropriate context when this
term is used.

* The training set consists of the data used to develop models while the test
or validation sets are used solely for evaluating the performance of a final
set of candidate models.
 
* The predictors, independent variables, attributes, or descriptors are the
data used as input for the prediction equation.

* Outcome, dependent variable, target, class, or response refer to the
outcome event or quantity that is being predicted.

* Outcome, dependent variable, target, class, or response refer to the
outcome event or quantity that is being predicted.

* Categorical data, otherwise known as nominal, attribute, or discrete data,
take on specific values that have no scale. Credit status (“good” or “bad”)
or color (“red,” “blue,” etc.) are examples of these data.

* Model building, model training, and parameter estimation all refer to the
process of using data to determine values of model equations.
